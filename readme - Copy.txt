This bar makes it simple to direct users to a visible call-to-action that you define.  In less than five minutes, you can be up and running with the Callout Bar on your WordPress website. The Callout Bar is a customizable toolbar that floats at the top or bottom of a website and makes it easy to get a visitors attention, generate opt-ins, and drive traffic to specific pages on your site. Our plugin is easy to setup, it’s highly customizable (font style, font color, bar color, bar height, etc.), and we have three actions so you can easily change how your Callout Bar functions. 

By default, the Callout Bar will load upon visitor click a modern and effective JavaScript opt-in pop-up form built by ContactUs.com. (If you’re new to ContactUs.com, this is what we specialize in as a company.)  Our forms are highly customizable, mobile optimized, and we sync with 21 popular email and database applications. It’s also free to create unlimited forms with our tool, and users get unlimited form submissions.  

If you’re not looking to generate a contact submission, email sign-up or capture a lead, the Callout Bar can also be used for simple messaging or navigation.  By changing the default setting, you can customize your Callout Bar to either provide new action (so that it’s text only), or direct it to navigate to a specific URL. 

When customizing the Callout Bar action, it’s also easy to load your own form code to deliver a custom experience for your site. 

When you use the Callout Bar form built by ContactUs.com, you can also get alerts via SMS (for premium users), email or direct the signups to 3rd party apps like MailChimp, Constant Contact, Google Docs, Zoho, SugarCRM, and many more (21 in all!).

In short, the Callout Bar can supercharge the engagement process with your users, increase opt-ins, and more effectively drive traffic to specific pages on your website.

When you download and install our plugin, you’ll be prompted to create an account, which will give you free access to our integrated contact management app hosted by ContactUs.com. Our web app also has additional customization options for admins who are creating forms, and we’re always adding new features to make your lead generation and contact management efforts easier and more effective.

We have premium (paid) plans with advanced features, but our standard features are always free, and they include unlimited form submissions.

**We built the Callout Bar so it’s simple and effective.** At ContactUs.com, we model best practices from dozens of companies and hundreds of influential bloggers and marketers across the world. We’ve seen and used similar floating bars on websites, and wanted to make this tool available for free for all WordPress users.

The Callout Bar also includes features that we built into our Contact Form by ContactUs.com plugin that has been downloaded over 60,000 times. This plugin makes it easy to create contact forms, opt-in newsletter forms, and is easily customizable. 

**Some of the features our users have come to expect with our plugins include...**

**Flexible Contact Forms for Every Occasion** - Our contact forms can be used for multiple uses such as: simple “Contact Us” contact form, Support contact form, a Price Quote Contact Form, Demo Request contact form, Newsletter signup form, “Advertise with Us” contact form, a Customer Feedback contact form, Request a Consultation contact form, and a Suggestion form. Using a custom form field template, you’ll be able to add or modify the form fields you need using our drag-and-drop editor.

**A Sophisticated Admin Panel to Further Customize Your Forms** - You can manage even more customizations for your contact form from inside your ContactUs.com account admin panel, which is easy to navigate to from inside your plugin. The customization options include form content such as the header, sub-header, button text and website info. Also, from your ContactUs.com account admin panel, you’ll be able to manage your delivery options for your contact form, whether to direct form signups to an email address, receive an SMS alert, or post inquiry information to over twenty 3rd party software tools like MailChimp, Zoho, Hubspot and Google Docs.

**Are there available Short Codes for posts and PHP snippets for temples?**

> 
> **Php Snippet:**
> 
> * echo do_shortcode('[show-callout-bar formkey="FORM KEY HERE"]');
> 
> Or use this one for the default callout bar:

> **WP Shortcode:**
> 
> * [show-callout-bar formkey="FORM KEY HERE"]
> 
> Or use this one for the default callout bar:

> * [show-callout-bar]


**Can you integrate with third party applications, such as MailChimp?**
> Yes, you can learn more about third party integration here: http://help.contactus.com/hc/en-us/articles/201818353-Newsletter-Form-Configuring-third-party-integrations

**How do I remove the callout tab that comes with the form?**
> This will probably happen to users who have previously installed our other plugins like Mail Chimp Form, Contact Form by ContactUs.com, and 8 others.  All you have to do is go to the Settings Tab, in the plugin settings page, and create a new form. Then set that new form as default.  
New users don’t need to do this. 
 
**What do you mean by HTML friendly?**

> It means, that if you don´t know how to code, its ok. The settings panel is mat to be a WYSIWYG. (What you see is what you get). But, if you want to embed an image, a link, a video, or want to add other html tags on the text that is displayed on the bar, you can! It’s just what we thought we would want to see in a plugin like this. 

**Can I have more than one callout bar?**

> Yes, you can build unlimited callout bars, and place them in different parts of your website. 

**Why must I create or login to a ContactUs.com account?**

> Our plugins aren’t just contact forms, they are extensions of the ContactUs.com application, which is cloud based, and enable users to perform form submission optimization, lead management, tab and form customization, A/B testing, manage auto responders, create advanced triggers and manage all of your forms, for multiple sites, from one place. 
In other words, our free tool is a cloud-based lead acquisition system for inbound traffic, and it’s made to make multitasking easier for optimization junkies. *Check this link out for AB testing: http://www.contactus.com/contactus-com-features/ab-test-your-signup-forms/ and Check this one for Hyperlink Triggers: http://www.contactus.com/hyperlink-trigger/
For example, if you have a mailing list that is fed from multiple landing pages, in multiple sites, and you wanted to test out 3 different call to actions, you could log into ContactUs.com, click on AB test, select the Tabs you want to try out and save. All of your forms would automatically be updated, testing would be initialized, all in a matter of seconds.

**Where can I get someone to help me with this?**

> If you need any specific tips on optimizing your online forms with our tools, or any other question, please feel free to ask, we would love to help out. We've got a support portal here: http://help.contactus.com, live chat on the page, and we're more than happy to answer questions directly in this plugin feedback area, or if you want to submit questions to support@contactus.com.
